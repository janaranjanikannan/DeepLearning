Beginner: Neural network training

In this notebook, I'll be implementing some of the steps in the training of the neural network, namely:

One-hot encoding the data
Scaling the data
Writing the backpropagation step

This is a self-assessed lab exercise part of "Intro to Machine Learning" Nanodegree.
